# Embedding models — research & comparison

---

## Goal

Short, practical research note to compare embedding options for RAG / semantic search / clustering.  
Highlight strengths, weaknesses, typical use cases, and an evaluation plan so you can select one for the assignment.

---

## Quick summary (one-liners)

- **Sentence Transformers (SBERT)** — proven semantic embeddings, many open-source variants; good for reproducible experiments and on-prem.  
- **BGE (e.g., bge-en-large, bge-m3)** — strong open-source all-rounder for RAG, consistently top performer in clinical IR and general retrieval.  
- **nomic-embed-text** — lightweight open-source embedder; fast, good for short/direct queries.  
- **mxbai-embed-large** — balanced mid-size model; better for long/contextual queries than nomic.  
- **SFR-Embedding-Mistral** — fine-tuned large model optimized for embeddings; strong but compute-heavy.  
- **OpenAI Embeddings** — high-quality managed API (e.g., `text-embedding-3-large`); easy integration, costly at scale.  
- **Cohere / Voyage AI** — API-first alternatives to OpenAI; strong multilingual and enterprise-ready.  
- **Hugging Face models (general)** — wide selection, flexible, and fine-tuneable; quality varies, benchmarking needed.

## What to compare (evaluation criteria)

1. **Semantic quality** — retrieval Recall@K, MRR, clustering purity.  
2. **Latency / throughput** — time per embedding, batch efficiency.  
3. **Cost** — API $ per 1k tokens vs infra cost for self-hosted.  
4. **Memory / size** — embedding dimension & model weights.  
5. **Licensing & restrictions** — open-source license vs API terms.  
6. **Language & domain support** — multilingual, medical, legal robustness.  
7. **Ease of deployment** — managed API vs self-hosting setup.  
8. **Ecosystem integrations** — vector DB and framework support.

## Decision guidance (at-a-glance)

| Model family                | Best when… |
|-----------------------------|------------|
| **SBERT / MiniLM**          | You want small, fast, reproducible embeddings on-prem. |
| **BGE (bge-en-large / m3)** | You want a strong, open-source general-purpose embedder for RAG (context-heavy queries). |
| **nomic-embed-text**        | You’re resource-limited and mostly handle short, direct queries. |
| **mxbai-embed-large**       | You need a middle ground: better than nomic, lighter than bge-m3. |
| **SFR-Embedding-Mistral**   | You have GPU infra and want high-quality embeddings from a large fine-tuned model. |
| **OpenAI / Cohere / Voyage**| You want fast prototyping or production-ready embeddings via API, and can afford cost/privacy tradeoffs. |
| **Hugging Face encoders**   | You want flexibility to fine-tune for a specific domain. |

## Extra note: (OpenAI vs Cohere vs E5)

A recent walkthrough compared three popular embedding options on messy, real-world data:

- **OpenAI (`ada-002`, 1536 dims):** strong baseline, reliable, but higher storage footprint and slower ingestion than Cohere.  
- **Cohere embeddings (1024 dims):** slightly faster ingestion; sometimes returned more context-rich results than OpenAI; strong multilingual support.  
- **E5 (768–1024 dims, open-source):** lightweight and efficient; base model weaker than APIs, but large variant can be competitive. Requires `passage:` / `query:` prefixing.

**Key takeaways:**  
- OpenAI = easy & strong default.  
- Cohere = good balance of quality + speed, especially for multilingual.  
- E5 = best when self-hosting or storage/cost efficiency matters (large version recommended).
