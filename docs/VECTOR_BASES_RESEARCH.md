# Vector Databases & Stores — Research & Comparison

## Overview
Vector databases manage and index **high-dimensional vector data**, which are critical for embedding-based similarity search, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), recommendations, and clustering applications.  
Unlike traditional SQL/NoSQL databases relying on exact match queries, vector databases enable **similarity search**, where queries are performed by *meaning* rather than keywords.

Modern applications powered by vector search include:
- **Recommendation systems** (e.g., Netflix, Spotify)  
- **Image and video search** (e.g., Google Images)  
- **Natural language processing** (e.g., chatbots, translation)  
- **E-commerce product suggestions** (e.g., Amazon)

## Vector Index vs Vector Database

### **Vector Index (e.g., Faiss)**
- Specialized structure for efficient similarity search (ANN algorithms like HNSW, IVF, PQ).  
- Fast nearest neighbor search among embeddings.  
- Used in research or prototyping.  
- **Limitations:** No persistence, metadata, transactions, or scaling; requires user infra.  

### **Vector Database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, MongoDB Atlas)**
- Full production-ready system combining indexing + data management.  
- Supports CRUD, metadata filtering, hybrid queries.  
- Built-in scaling, backups, and API-driven operations.  
- Designed for real-time, large-scale deployments.

## Core ANN Algorithms & Concepts
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN):** Fast search with accuracy-speed tradeoff.  
- **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH):** Groups similar vectors to reduce comparisons.  
- **Product Quantization (PQ):** Compresses vectors for efficient search.  
- **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World):** Graph-based scalable ANN.  
- **Similarity Metrics:** Cosine similarity, Euclidean (L2), dot-product.

## Practical Notes & Best Practices
- Use **Faiss** for prototyping, research, and on-prem workloads.  
- Deploy **vector databases** (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, MongoDB Atlas) for production.  
- Choose embedding models carefully (dimensionality affects accuracy, storage, performance).  
- Apply **hybrid search** (keyword + vector) for better relevance.  
- Balance **latency vs recall** — faster queries often reduce accuracy.

## Summary
- **Faiss** → Best for experimentation and prototyping.  
- **Pinecone** → SaaS with ease of use, metadata support, and scalability.  
- **Weaviate** → Semantic + graph context, hybrid queries.  
- **Milvus** → Open-source flexibility; multiple ANN options; large-scale workloads.
